Apart from Roman remains, works by top contemporary artists like Giorgos Zogolopoulos, and one of the city’s oldest modern sculptures—a marble bust of Enlightenment scholar Neophytos Doukas by Christian Hansen are placed in the park. Commuters using the nearby Evangelismos metro station have the opportunity to admire Samuel Beckett’s Cascando, whose verses are used in an installation by artist David Harding, marking the limits of the park. This unique urban park also hosts three sculptures which belong to the Municipality of Athens, namely “Massification” by Yiorgos Lambrou, “Plastic Vision” by Yiorgos Kalakalas and “Synthesis” by Christos Kapralos.
