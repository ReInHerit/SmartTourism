The Vasilissis Sofias avenue is one of the main and most important avenues in central Athens. It connects the city centre with the rest of the city. The first “European Avenue” of the Greek state, it was the face of Athens in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century when the area was full of farmlands and the only buildings that existed in Athens were the Royal Palace (now Greek Parliament), the Mansion of the Duchess of the Plaissance (today’s Christian and Byzantine Museum) and the Petraki Monastery. As the city started to grow and a city plan was set up, neoclassical buildings were built on both sides of the road.

Today, the Vasilissis Sofias avenue continues to play an important role in the life of the Athenians. Apart from being an important arterial road, it is still one of the most beautiful and iconic streets of Athens. It is home to embassies, the European Union’s representation in Greece, world-renowned museums, cultural institutions and high-end apartment blocks. Although many of the neoclassical buildings of the past were replaced by modern 8 or 9 floor apartment blocks, there are still many stunning neoclassical buildings in the area. One such example is the Stathatos Mansion which houses part of the Museum of Cycladic Art or the Benaki Museum building.

As in the past, the area is connected with the political life of the country as the Presidential Mansion and the Parliament are located in the area. It is still one of the most expensive areas of Athens. Housing the National Garden, it is also a quite popular and diachronic spot for long walks for the Athenians.
