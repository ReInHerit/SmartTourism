The first urban buildings of the area were built in the interwar period in the 1920’s and 1930’s by important architects of the time. These multistory buildings offered unusual and luxurious amenities for their residents at that time including elevators with internal door and a shelter in the basement. (Google Maps: https://shorturl.at/mCFX6 ) The past and present mingle in this area where one can see buildings which follow eclecticism and modernism and also modern-day buildings as is the case with main streets such as Skoufa street, around the church of St. Dionysios. (Google maps: https://shorturl.at/lCHV3). These buildings take you on a journey in time from neoclassicism through to art deco and the dominant style of apartment blocks in Athens since the interwar period.
