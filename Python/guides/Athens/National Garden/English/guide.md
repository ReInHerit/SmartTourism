The National Garden is a public park of 15.5 hectares (38 acres) in the center of the Greek capital, Athens and it is a lovely environment to relax but also take in some history. It is located between the districts of Kolonaki and Pangrati, directly behind the Greek Parliament building (The Old Palace) and continues to the South to the area where the Zappeion is located, across from the Panathenaiko or Kallimarmaro Olympic Stadium of the 1896 Olympic Games.

The garden was commissioned by Queen Amalia in 1838 and it is considered her biggest work. At the time, the National Garden was the Royal Garden and was completed by 1840 by the German agronomist Friedrich Schmidt. He imported more than 500 plant species from Greece and around the world, including many tropical plants. Unfortunately, not all of these plants survived the Mediterranean climate. The National Garden is considered as characteristic of the 19th century landscape design. A Roman floor, uncovered -during 19th-century excavations- at a depth of one meter, belonging to the courtyard of a Roman villa very near from what is now the entrance on Vasilissis Sophias Avenue.

The Garden encloses ancient ruins, column drums and Corinthian capitals of columns, mosaics, rare plants and birds. There are leafy labyrinth paths, wooden benches, animals and small pods which make it an oasis in the heart of Athens. On the Southeast side are the busts of Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first governor of Greece, and of the Philhellene Jean-Gabriel Eynard. On the South side there are the busts of the celebrated Greek poets Dionysios Solomos, author of the National Anthem of Greece, and Aristotelis Valaoritis.

<p align="justify" style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;">
Nowadays, the garden is home to 7,000 trees, 40,000 bushes, and other plants, making up 519 species and varieties. More than 100 of them are Greek while others come from countries all over the world, such as Australian pines or Chinese trees-of-heaven.

It is a popular area where locals and visitors can have a walk, jog or simply enjoy the shade of the trees during a hot summer day. As Henry Miller wrote in 1939: "It remains in my memory like no other park I have known. It is the quintessence of a park, the thing one feels sometimes in looking at a canvas or dreaming of a place one would like to be in and never finds."

Exhibitions, actions for the protection of the environment as well as initiatives for the planting and adoption of new trees everywhere in the city also take place in the national garden. It hosts a small zoo, a Botanical Museum, and a conservatory which is the place where plants are initially cultivated before being replanted in the garden - considered as the country’s first working greenhouse. Moreover, it hosts the Camp of the Evzones, a children's library with more than 6.000 books, a playground, and a small café, while particularly popular are also the duck pond and the sundial, a traditional method of telling the time. The garden is open all day until night falls, and it is also wheelchair accessible.
