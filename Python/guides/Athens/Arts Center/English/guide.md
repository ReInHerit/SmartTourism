The City of Athens Arts Centre at Parko Eleftherias stands as a pivotal institution in the heart of the capital city. Nestled within a complex comprising four military architecture edifices, this site is a former torture chamber for Greek military police (EAT-ESA) interrogations during the period of dictatorship (1967–1974). Today, these very buildings have been transformed into bastions of historical memory and culture, championing the cause of free speech and artistic expression.
This contemporary Arts Centre serves as a dynamic exhibition space, playing host to solo and group exhibitions encompassing a wide spectrum of creative media such as painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography, installation, and performance art. Its allure extends to art-loving Athenians and visitors alike, acting as a beacon for contemporary art and fostering a vibrant platform for artistic expression.
