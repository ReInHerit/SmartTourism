The Medieval city of Nicosia was built around the Pedieos River and today includes areas like Agioi Omologites, Koupati, Eleniou, Omeriye, and Old Town. While tradition suggests that a circular wall enclosed the city during the Byzantine era, there is no archaeological evidence to support this.
The first city wall was constructed in the 14th century AD by the Franks of the House of Lusignan. It had nine gate-towers and divided the city into north and south, with the Pedieos River flowing through it. The original walls enclosed a larger area than today's walled city but were dismantled after 80 years when the Republic of Venice took control of Cyprus in 1489. The Venetian walls were then constructed using materials from the old walls and remnants of public and private buildings from the 14th to 16th centuries.
The Venetian walls in Nicosia were built between 1567 and 1570 by Giulio Savorgnano and are 4.38 kilometers long. They have 11 bastions arranged in a heart-shaped pattern and three gates. The walls were primarily built with bricks and reinforced with stone and a moat surrounded them. When the Ottomans occupied Nicosia, they renovated the walls by adding stone covers to their upper parts.
The moat surrounding the walls now serves as sports fields, public gardens, and parking spaces for the modern city's inhabitants.
