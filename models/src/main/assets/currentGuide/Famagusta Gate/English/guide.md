    The Famagusta Gate, also known as "Porta Giuliana", was a passageway to the provinces and harbors of Famagusta and Larnaca. It was located east of the Venetian walls and had a lower ground level inside compared to outside. The area between the Castle Gate (now Famagusta Gate) and the Gate of Saint Dominic was famous for its gardens with lemon trees, vineyards, pomegranates, and date palms. 
Famagusta Gate's impressive facade boasts an arched door, oval windows, and marble lintels. Its interior features a central chamber with a spacious vaulted passage, flanked by two parallel guard chambers. Today, the gate serves as the Nicosia Municipal Cultural Centre for lectures, art exhibitions, and various artistic activities.
