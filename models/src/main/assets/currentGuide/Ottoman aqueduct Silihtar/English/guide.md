As you walk from Famagusta Gate towards the Archbishopric Palace, you can spot the remains of the arches that once dominated the area near the gate and the Statue of Liberty. These arches are part of the Ottoman aqueduct named "Silihtar," which was built in the 18th century to supply water to the neighborhoods within the city walls.
