The house initially belonged to the Podocataros family, prominent urban dwellers in 16th-century Cyprus who had embraced Catholicism. Following the Ottoman era, the property transitioned into the possession of Dragomanos (interpreter) Kornesios. Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios served as an intermediary with administrative and economic authority between the Ottoman authorities and the island's inhabitants from 1779 to 1809.
This two-story stone mansion underwent renovation by Hadjigeorgakis in 1793, and today stands as a distinguished example of 18th-century urban architecture in Cyprus. The entrance door, intricately carved, features the coat of arms depicting the double-headed eagle and the lion of Venice. The ground floor's original purpose was to store wine and olive oil and house staff quarters, while the first floor's reception hall, known as the 'oda' (good chamber), still stands as a preserved reminder of the mansion's rich history.
Dragomanos Kornesios was a wealthy man from Kritou Terra. He was well-educated, fluent in Turkish, and had connections with Archbishop Chrysanthos. Despite his service to the Ottoman Porte, he was arrested and executed in Turkey. His descendants donated his house to the church and the Department of Antiquities. After its declaration as a public monument, restoration efforts began in 1987.
