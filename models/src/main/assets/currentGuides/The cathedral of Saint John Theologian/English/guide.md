Just behind the Museum of Folk Art stands the Cathedral of Saint John the Theologian. The church was built in 1662 on the site where the chapel of Saint John the Baptist once stood, which was part of the Frankish Monastery of the Order of Saint Benedict. After the monastery was abandoned in 1426, the Church of Cyprus started using this church. In the churchyard, three kings of Cyprus, Hugh I, Queen Alice, and Hugh II, are buried. The entire interior of the church is adorned with 18th-century frescoes, including a fresco illustrating the history of the autocephalous Church of Cyprus.
