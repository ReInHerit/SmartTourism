The Paphos Gate, also known as the Gate of San Domenico, was one of the three gates built by the Venetians around Nicosia. The name 'Porta di San Domenico' seems to have originated from an earlier gate of the Frankish walls, named after the nearby abbey or monastery of San Domenico. It is believed that the second royal palace of the Lusignans was located within the boundaries of this monastery.
The Paphos Gate, part of which serves as the headquarters for the Police and Fire Services, was the site of recent excavations that unearthed remnants of the Ottoman aqueduct known as 'Arab Ahmet.' This aqueduct provided Nicosia with water during the Ottoman era.
