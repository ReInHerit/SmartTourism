According to tradition Faneromeni was either built on the remains of an older chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary or on the foundations of a monastery. The three-aisled church of Faneromeni has a courtyard to the east, within which stands a marble mausoleum. This mausoleum contains the remains of Archbishop Kyprianos and other clergymen who were executed by the Ottomans in 1821 during the Greek uprising. Although Archbishop Kyprianos did not participate in the Greek revolution, Governor Kuchuk Mehmet, on behalf of the Ottoman authorities, ordered the execution of prominent figures as a punitive measure.
