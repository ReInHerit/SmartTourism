The Faneromeni School is located opposite the mausoleum where Archbishop Kyprianos and other clergymen were buried by the Ottomans in 1821. It was originally a girls' school, founded by Archbishop Makarios I in 1859. The school building features Greek neoclassical architectural characteristics, as well as incorporating distinct elements from the local Cypriot style. In 2014, it was announced that the building would be used as the School of Architecture for the University of Cyprus.
