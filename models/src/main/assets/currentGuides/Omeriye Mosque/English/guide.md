After the Ottoman Empire conquered the island, they built various mosques and added minarets to almost all the existing Gothic religious buildings. One such example is the church of Saint Mary of the Augustinians, which was partially destroyed during a bombardment in 1570 and later transformed into the Emerke or Ömeriye Mosque in 1571. The church was founded by Augustinian monks in the early 14th century and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The church contained tombs of notable Frankish families within its grounds. Today, the only remains of this ancient abbey are a facade from the early Renaissance period, still attached to the present Muslim mosque.
Around the Ömeriye Mosque in Ömeriye Square, besides Hatzigeorgakis Kornesios' house, visitors can explore abandoned traditional-style houses featuring old arches, remnants of former workshops, and the Ottoman baths. These baths, once exclusive to Muslim residents of Nicosia, continue operating today, welcoming both men and women.
