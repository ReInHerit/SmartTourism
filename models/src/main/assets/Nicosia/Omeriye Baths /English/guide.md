Ömeriye hammam is located in Nicosia's old town next to the Ömeriye Mosque. Constructed by Lala Mustafa Pasha in 1570-1571, the baths were named after the caliph Omar and the area became known as Ömeriye. The baths were likely constructed to meet the religious needs of the nearby mosque. Today, they provide all the essential amenities for bathing, relaxing, and rejuvenating.
