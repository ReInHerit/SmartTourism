The Cultural Foundation of the Bank of Cyprus was established in 1984 and is housed in the old administrative building of the Bank of Cyprus, which was built in 1936. It promotes the research and study of Cypriot culture and aims to preserve and disseminate the country's cultural and natural heritage. The foundation curates five notable Cypriot collections encompassing coins, maps, rare books, manuscripts, engravings, old photographs, contemporary Cypriot art, and the archaeological collection.   
Besides the Cypriot collections, visitors can also explore the Agora at the Bank's Foundation. They have the opportunity to purchase replicas, imitations, and books related to the collection to learn more about the original exhibits.
