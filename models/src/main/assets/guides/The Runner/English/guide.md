<h1 align="center">The Runner</h1>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;">
The Runner is an iconic sculpture created by the sculptor Costas Varotsos. No other sculpture has connected its existence with the contemporary urban history of Athens more than the Runner. Initially constructed in 1988, the Runner was supposed to be placed in Omonia square of Athens for one month in the framework of a temporary exhibition called “Dromena” which would place contemporary works of art in different spots of the city of Athens. The aim of the exhibition was to familiarize the Athenians with contemporary works of art and also to add value to the Greek capital’s design identity. The installation remained on spot much longer than one month and throughout this period, the Runner was on the spotlight, gaining lovers and haters. This 8-meter-tall sculpture is made exclusively out of green glass. As the material that was initially used for the construction was not appropriate for long-term exhibition of the sculpture outdoors, it was temporarily moved to another place, for redesign. Following its redesign in 1994, it was placed on the Vasilissis Sofias Avenue, opposite the iconic former Athens Hilton hotel and the National Gallery.  This oversized sculpture is human-like and gives the feeling of constant movement, resembling the movement of a runner finally reaching the destination. Located in a busy city spot, it also serves as a reminder for Athenians and visitors that no matter how tiring a journey can be, arriving at the destination is always worth the effort.
