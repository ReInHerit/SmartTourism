<h1 align="center”>The Museum of Cycladic Art</h1>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;">
The Museum of Cycladic Art was founded in 1986 with the aim to host the archeological collection of Nikolaos and Aikaterini (Dolly) Goulandris with works of Cycladic and Ancient Greek Art. The museum features four permanent exhibitions, namely Cycladic Culture, Ancient Greek Art, Cypriot Art and Scenes from Everyday Life in Antiquity. The Museum of Cycladic Art is housed at the Stathatos Mansion which was designed by the Bavarian architect Ernst Ziller. The mansion is one of the most important examples of Neoclassical architecture in nineteenth-century Athens.

The Museum of Cycladic Art houses one of the most complete private collections of Cycladic art worldwide, with representative objects from all phases of the distinctive Cycladic island culture that flourished in the central Aegean during the Early Bronze Age (third millennium BC). The collection of Ancient Greek Art covers a wide time span from the 2nd millennium BC to the 4th c. AD. Ancient Cypriot Art exhibition is one of the largest outside Cyprus. It is a fascinating example of cultural amalgamation in antiquity and exemplifies the intense level of interaction among ancient Mediterranean cultures.

The Museum has a contemporary art programme which presents important works of art of contemporary artists from Greece and abroad. In 2017 the Museum launched the exhibition series “Divine Dialogues”. Ancient artefacts are presented next to modern and contemporary artworks, initiating a dialogue.
