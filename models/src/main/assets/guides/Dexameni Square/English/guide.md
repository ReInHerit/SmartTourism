<h1 align="center”>The Dexameni Square</h1>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;">
Dexameni is another famous square in the Kolonaki area, quiet and laid back compared to the main Kolonaki square. 
Dexameni means reservoir as this square was built exactly on a reservoir, the first water supply system which was constructed by Hadrian. 
The Dexameni (which today belongs to the Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company) supplied water to Athens until the middle of the 20th century. 
Built in the 2nd century AD during the reign of Hadrian, the Dexameni stored the water that reached the city through the water supply system. 
The system was abandoned during the Turkish occupation and reopened in 1840. 
Next to the Hadrian Reservoir, a new one was built for the water supply needs of the center of Athens.

In the mid-1800s, the reservoir was restored and in the interwar period was briefly converted into a children’s swimming pool, but today it's only used once a year for a religious observance called “Theophania”. The square can also be seen as counter-culture in Kolonaki—a favourite spot for those who are after something simple and serene under the shade of the trees. In the 1930s, Dexameni was known as the spot of intellectual Athenians and famous writers such as Kazantzakis, Sikelianos, Papadiamantis, and Varnalis. In the square, there is a bust of the Nobel-prize winner Greek novelist Odysseas Elytis which was created by the famous sculptor Yiannis Pappas. Odysseas Elytis loved the area and enjoyed the shade of trees and the inspiration the place offers from his favourite café.

The ouzeri – Greek tavern- of the area where people met has survived various incarnations. 
Today, children can play in the playground and parents can enjoy the historical café area, which in the past has been a favourite place for those influential Greek poets and artists. 
The café offers traditional Greek meze, coffee and drinks and can be quite busy after sunset. 
During summertime, a summer cinema also operates in the area by the cultural centre of the workers of the Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company (EYDAP), which is worth visiting. 
Tickets for the cinema can be bought at the cinema booth after 8 pm. A canteen is also available in the cinema area offering drinks and snacks.
